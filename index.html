  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This algorithm can predict the prices of the bitcoins in the upcoming days with the help of LSTM. Long short-term memory is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture used in the field of deep learning.
    The sole purpose of developing the predictor using LSTM is that the accuracy of LSTM is higher than any other machine learning algorithm.</p>

  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe have many Techniques and Algorithms for encrypting the data and then transmitting it through the global medium. Many encryption algorithms are developed for securing and maintaining the integrity of the data. This paper gives a basic
    comparison between the various encryption techniques. These techniques are compared on one basic criteria of block and stream cipher.</p>
